    <h3>What is the difference between var and let?</h3>
    <p> The <b>var</b> variables are append to the windows or a function and we could redeclare and redefine these variables, and <b>let</b> variables are append to block-scopes and we could redefine the value but not redeclare the variable. </p>

    <h3>What is hoisting?</h3>
    <p>It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using var, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.</p>
